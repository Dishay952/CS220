# Assignment 1 CS202

## Question 1: 8-bit Ripple Carry Adder

> 'adder.v' is the implementation of a 1-bit full adder. 
> <br>
> 'RCA_8.v' is the implementation of a 8-bit ripple carry adder using the 1-bit full adder described above.
> <br>
> 'RCA_8_tb.v' is the testbench with 15 inputs.
> <br>

## Question 2: 8-bit Comparator

> 'comparator.v' is the implementation of a 1-bit comparator. 
> <br>
> 'comparator_8.v' is the implementation of a 8-bit comparator using the 1-bit comparator described above.
> <br>
> 'comparator_8_tb.v' is the testbench with 15 inputs.


## Question 3: 3-to-8 Decoder

> 'three_to_eight.v' contains the implementation of a 2-to-4 encoder which is then used to create a 3-to-8 encoder. This is done by using 3 decoders. 
> <br>
> 'three_to_eight_tb.v' is the testbench with all possible inputs.

## Question 4: 8-to-3 Priority Encoder

> 'three_to_eight.v' contains the implementation of a 2-to-4 encoder which is then used to create a 3-to-8 encoder. This is done by using 3 decoders. 
> <br>
> 'three_to_eight_tb.v' is the testbench with all possible inputs.
