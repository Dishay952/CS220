# Assignment 1 CS202

## Question 1: 8-bit Ripple Carry Adder

> 'A1Q1_one_bit_full_adder.v' is the implementation of a 1-bit full adder. 
> <br>
> 'A1Q1_eight_bit_ripple_carry_adder.v' is the implementation of a 8-bit ripple carry adder using the 1-bit full adder described above.
> <br>
> 'A1Q1_eight_bit_ripple_carry_adder_tb.v' is the testbench with 15 inputs.
> <br>

## Question 2: 8-bit Comparator

> 'A1Q2_one_bit_comparator.v' is the implementation of a 1-bit comparator. 
> <br>
> 'A1Q2_eight_bit_comparator.v' is the implementation of a 8-bit comparator using the 1-bit comparator described above.
> <br>
> 'A1Q2_eight_bit_comparator_tb.v' is the testbench with 15 inputs.


## Question 3: 3-to-8 Decoder

> 'A1Q3_three_to_eight_decoder.v' contains the implementation of a 2-to-4 encoder which is then used to create a 3-to-8 encoder. This is done by using 3 decoders. 
> <br>
> 'A1Q3_three_to_eight_decoder_tb.v' is the testbench with all possible inputs.

## Question 4: 8-to-3 Priority Encoder

> 'A1Q4_eight_to_three_priotity_encoder.v' contains the implementation of a 2-to-4 encoder which is then used to create a 3-to-8 encoder. This is done by using 3 decoders. 
> <br>
> 'A1Q4_eight_to_three_priotity_encoder_tb.v' is the testbench with all possible inputs.
